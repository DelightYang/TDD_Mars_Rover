# TDD_Mars_Rover
## 30mins to the mars! alright thats just a joke ;) 
## At least at this moment XD

### -
#### So，
#### The Rover can move forward and move back
#### The Rover can only move in a specific region
#### The Rover can turn left and right

#### The Rover may encounter obstacle / obstacles，so you'd design a good mechanism to handle that ;)

#### All requirements are not that strict as you may wish :) Feel free to design.
